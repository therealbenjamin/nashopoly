      %ul
        %li Why does your game look so much like Hasbro's Monopoly?
        %li Shut your cakehole, jerk. Nashopoly looks nothing like Monopoly.
        %li If you contend that Nashopoly was not based on Monopoly, what inspired the game?
        %li We, the creators of this fabled product, were inspired by nothing more than a love of the Athens of the South and a few highballs of Tennessee Tea.
        %li Where can I purchase your Monopoly knockoff?
        %li Nashopoly is not a Monopoly knockoff. Haven't we been over this? Sheesh!
        %li Okay, then where can I purchase "Nashopoly?"
        %li We currently sell Nashopoly at one convenient location in the Nashville airport. Go to concourse C. You can purchase Nashopoly at the kiosk in between gates C8 and C9. Next to the Cinnabon.
        %li How does one turn weakness into power?
        %li When you are weaker, never fight for honor's sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to recover, time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait for his power to wane. Do not give him the satisfaction of fighting and defeating you - surrender first. By turning the other cheek you infuriate and unsettle him. Make surrender a tool of power.
        %li How can I become the perfect courtier?
        %li The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity. He has mastered the art of indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and assert power over others in the most oblique and graceful manner. Learn and apply the laws of courtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can rise in the court.
        %li How can I overcome past failures?
        %li Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Recreate yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores an audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define it for you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions - your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life.
        %li How can I make a strong impression?
        %li If your are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution. Timidity is dangerous: better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.
