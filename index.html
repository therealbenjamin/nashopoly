          <h3>About Nashopoly</h3>
          <p>Due to a pending lawsuit in United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, Nashville Division, the makers of Nashopoly are obligated to inform visitors to this site that we are in no way affiliated with Hasbro. Nashopoly is nothing like Monopoly. Seriously, guys.</p>
